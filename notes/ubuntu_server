# Notes
I had to tag feline for nvim and remove cmd enter from telescope in ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/init.lua
Had to change where asdf sources from

Try best to install linuxbrew first next time and install all deps from there where posible

cgroups systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false change boot params
or /etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml cgroups = true 
this issue may only be ubuntu 20.10 server
